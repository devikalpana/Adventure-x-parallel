                  Barcelona's architectural wonders by Gaudí, the bustling markets, and Mediterranean beaches capture the essence of 
                  vibrant Spanish culture. Bangkok's ornate temples, street markets brimming with exotic flavors, and a rich cultural
                   tapestry make it a favorite for adventurous travelers.

                Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.Plan to get on your bike and ride for 30-60 minutes, 3-5 days a week

Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime
